Sometimes, responsibility means that you’re the only one who can change things.

Buddhism considers the self to be a fiction and the primary cause of human suffering. Whenever you crave material things like expensive cars and clothes, or desire compliments to enhance your reputation, or seek positions of status and power to benefit your life, Buddhism says you are treating your fictional self as real (reifying the self). These material concerns may bring immediate gratification and pleasure but they also entrap you, like golden handcuffs, and cause persistent suffering, which we would call prolonged unpleasant affect. To a Buddhist, a self is worse than a passing physical illness. It is an enduring affliction.

Overall, your self is like a collection of dos and don’ts that summarizes your likes, dislikes, and habits in the moment.

There’s overt abuse and neglect, of course, but also an avalanche of smaller events. The steady stream of violence they witness on TV and in movies, videos, and computer games. The degrading language they hear in popular music and casually mimic as they greet peers with “Hey, bitch.” (Is it a friendly hello, an insult, or a threat?) The rise of bullying as a form of joking because on television, people say horrible things to each other to the sound of a laugh track. Add to this the almost limitless opportunities for social rejection that texting and some forms of social media provide, combined with not enough sleep and exercise, plus too much pseudo-food of dubious nutritional quality, and you have a cultural recipe for a generation of adults with chronic body misbudgeting.

The best defense against affective realism is curiosity. I tell my students to be particularly mindful when you love or hate something you read. These feelings probably mean that the ideas you’ve read are firmly in your affective niche, so keep an open mind about them.
