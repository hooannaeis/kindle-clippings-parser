Like early industrial companies, early information brokers have an exploitative relationship with the resource they mine and sell. Today,

Today’s internet is where the US auto industry was in the early sixties, and data privacy and cybersecurity are the seatbelts most companies aren’t that interested in.

the easiest way to explain the relationship between data privacy and security is to think about it like your house. If you have an alarm system, three locks on every door, and bars on the windows, your house is probably fairly secure. You’ve made it as hard as possible for bad people to break in and steal your stuff or hurt your family. But if anyone can peer in from the street because you leave the curtains open, your house isn’t private.

Shakespeare: If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces.

Confidentiality is the assurance that data is only being accessed and used by those with the authorization or legal right to do so—which defines a data breach as: an unauthorized person gaining access to confidential information, thus breaching its confidentiality.

Integrity is about the completeness and accuracy of data.

You can’t use data that is unavailable, so availability is a much larger topic we’ll touch on later.

The best way to determine what data your company has stored where is to conduct interviews. Break your business down into its core functions (HR, finance, marketing, sales, customer service, etc.) and then delineate the data processing activities that take place within each.

An annual data inventory is the foundation of a solid privacy program. Without it, you are merely guessing at what is needed in your company from a privacy perspective.

In implementing a Defense in Depth strategy, I advise using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 5-part cybersecurity framework it calls IPDRR for Identification, Protection, Detection, Response, and Resilience.

Ask yourself: What are the vital business functions that, if disrupted, would cause the most catastrophic impact?
