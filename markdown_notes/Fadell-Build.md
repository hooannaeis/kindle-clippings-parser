Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less.

“The only failure in your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error.”

Bill Gurley, the incredibly smart, wry, contrarian Silicon Valley VC and Texan deal maker, puts it this way: “I can’t make you the smartest or the brightest, but it’s doable to be the most knowledgeable. It’s possible to gather more information than somebody else.”

As an IC, you need to occasionally do two things: 1. Look up: Look beyond the next deadline or project and forward to all the milestones coming up in the next few months. Then look all the way down to your ultimate goal: the mission.

2. Look around: Get out of your comfort zone and away from the immediate team you’re on. Talk to the other functions in your company to understand their perspectives, needs, and concerns.



Write down a list of what you’re worried about for each project and person so you can immediately see when the list is getting too long and you need to either dive deeper or back off.

The bullshit-asymmetry theory, Brandolini’s law, will be at play here: “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude higher than to produce it.”

People won’t remember how you started. They’ll remember how you left.

that was the wrong place, wrong people, wrong everything. So I figured—screw it. I’ll do it myself. The words that launched a thousand startups.

Nothing could stop us. And those, of course, are the words that launched a thousand startups right off a cliff.

A good product story has three elements: »  It appeals to people’s rational and emotional sides. »  It takes complicated concepts and makes them simple. » It reminds people of the problem that’s being solved—it focuses on the “why.” That “why” is the most critical part of product development—it has to come first.

Vision: Know what you want to make, why you’re making it, who it’s for, and why people will buy it.

You will encounter a crisis eventually. Everyone does. If you don’t, you’re not doing anything important or pushing any boundaries. When you’re creating something disruptive and new, you will at some point be blindsided by a complete disaster.

Keep your focus on how to fix the problem, not who to blame.

2. As a leader, you’ll have to get into the weeds. Don’t be worried about micromanagement—as the crisis unfolds your job is to tell people what to do and how to do it.

3. Get advice. From mentors, investors, your board, or anyone else you know who’s gone through something similar. Don’t try to solve your problems alone.

4. Your job once people get over the initial shock will be constant communication.

5. It doesn’t matter if the crisis was caused by your mistake or your team or a fluke accident: accept responsibility for how it has affected customers and apologize.

The most valuable thing you’ll take out of any crisis is the tale of how you were almost swept away, but the team pulled together and saved the day.

here’s what I’ve learned about some of the key teams and competencies of most startups: Design Marketing Product management Sales Legal

The fear is that everyone used to do all these cool, different things and now someone is going to come and take them away. So focus people’s attention on the opportunity: help them get curious about what their job could become, instead of being fearful of what they might lose.

They tried something and failed, and that means they learned. That’s okay. Life is the process of elimination and now they’re free to try something new.

The best CEOs push the team to strive for greatness, then take care of them to make sure they can achieve it. The worst CEOs care only about maintaining the status quo.

The job is to give a shit. To care. About everything.

You’ll say good enough is not good enough.

Most people are happy with 90 percent good. Most leaders will take pity on their teams and just let it slide. But going from 90 to 95 percent is halfway to perfect. Getting the last part of the journey right is the only way to reach your destination.
