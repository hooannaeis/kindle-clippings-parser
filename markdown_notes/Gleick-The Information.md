Plato (channeling the nonwriter Socrates) warned that this technology meant impoverishment: For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.

But the new channel does more than extend the previous channel. It enables reuse and “re-collection”—new modes. It permits whole new architectures of information. Among them are history, law, business, mathematics, and logic.

Chinese unifies an array of distinct spoken languages: people who cannot speak to one another can write to one another. It employs at least fifty thousand symbols, about six thousand commonly used and known to most literate Chinese.

Chinese thus became an extreme case: the largest set of symbols, and the most meaningful individually.

An intermediate stage is the syllabary, a phonetic writing system using individual characters to represent syllables,

The writing system at the opposite extreme took the longest to emerge: the alphabet, one symbol for one minimal sound. The alphabet is the most reductive, the most subversive of all scripts. In all the languages of earth there is only one word for alphabet (alfabet, alfabeto, ).

If the ideal of communication is a meeting of souls, then writing is a sad shadow of the ideal. The same criticism was made of other constrained channels, created by later technologies—the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and e-mail.

“The larger the number of senses involved, the better the chance of transmitting a reliable copy of the sender’s mental state.”

Not that anyone knew what electricity was. “An invisible, intangible, imponderable agent,” said one authority.

“Existence of telephone traffic is essentially an indication that time is being saved,” the department commented.
