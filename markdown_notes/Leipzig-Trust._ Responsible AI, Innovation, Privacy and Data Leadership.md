Put another way, the losses that have been incurred because of data privacy and security lapses last year are about equal to the $7 trillion it is estimated that generative AI will add to our global economy over the next ten years.

Key Definitions Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn" from large amounts of data.3 Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.

As a CEO or board member, you should request a briefing on AI uses in your company and cover the following questions: •How are we using AI? •Have we segregated training data so we know the provenance of the data used to train our model? •Are we using protected data to train the model that can be subject to opt out or removal requests? •How are we testing, monitoring, and auditing for accuracy, fairness, elimination of bias, and privacy, separate and distinct for cybersecurity, product safety, IP, and antitrust considerations? Are our testing, monitoring, auditing, and mitigation efforts reflected in our logging and metadata emanating from the AI system itself? •How can we review and approve governance policies for AI that include human review by management? •Are we developing AI in accordance with putative legislative and regulatory expectations? Are we mapping our governance to the draft EU AI
