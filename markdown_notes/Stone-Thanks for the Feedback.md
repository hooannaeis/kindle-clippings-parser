WHAT COUNTS AS FEEDBACK? Feedback includes any information you get about yourself.

It’s about how to learn from feedback—yes, even when it is off base, unfair, poorly delivered, and frankly, you’re not in the mood.

In addition to our desire to learn and improve, we long for something else that is fundamental: to be loved, accepted, and respected just as we are.

triggers are obstacles, but they aren’t only obstacles. Triggers are also information—a kind of map—that can help us locate the source of the trouble.

Truth Triggers are set off by the substance of the feedback itself—it’s somehow off, unhelpful, or simply untrue. In response, we feel indignant, wronged, and exasperated.

Identity Triggers focus neither on the feedback nor on the person offering it. Identity triggers are all about us. Whether the feedback is right or wrong, wise or witless, something about it has caused our identity—our sense of who we are—to come undone.

Broadly, feedback comes in three forms: appreciation (thanks), coaching (here’s a better way to do it), and evaluation (here’s where you stand).

Managing truth triggers is not about pretending there’s something to learn, or saying you think it’s right if you think it’s wrong. It’s about recognizing that it’s always more complicated than it appears and working hard to first understand.

feedback in relationships is rarely the story of you or me. It’s more often the story of you and me. It’s the story of our relationship system.

Why is it that when we give feedback we so often feel right, yet when we receive feedback it so often feels wrong?

Three qualities are required for appreciation to count. First, it has to be specific. This is tricky; most of us offer both appreciation and positive evaluation in grand strokes like “Good work!” or “You were fabulous!” or “Thanks for everything!”

Second, appreciation has to come in a form the receiver values and hears clearly.

For some, a monthly paycheck is all the “attaboy” they need. For others, public recognition is meaningful, whether in the form of team e-mail, kudos at a meeting, or organizational awards. For some it’s promotion and titles—even if they earn the same or less pay.

Ask yourself three questions: (1) What’s my purpose in giving/receiving this feedback? (2) Is it the right purpose from my point of view? (3) Is it the right purpose from the other person’s point of view?

Remember: Explicit disagreement is better than implicit misunderstanding.

Remember: Explicit disagreement is better than implicit misunderstanding. Explicit disagreement leads to clarity, and is the first step in each of you getting your differing needs met.

If your organization has formal feedback conversations at yearly or semiyearly intervals (where, for example, supervisor and supervisee develop objectives or a learning plan for the coming year, with specific skills and outcomes targeted), the evaluation conversation and the coaching conversation should be separated by at least days, and probably longer.

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS “Feedback” is really three different things, with different purposes: Appreciation — motivates and encourages. Coaching — helps increase knowledge, skill, capability, growth, or raises feelings in the relationship. Evaluation — tells you where you stand, aligns expectations, and informs decision making.

So to clarify the feedback under the label we need to “be specific” about two things: (1) where the feedback is coming from, and (2) where the feedback is going.

while computers are organized around managing and accessing data, human intelligence is organized around stories.

away from that’s wrong and toward tell me more: Let’s figure out why we see this differently.

All things being equal, we’ll find a sympathetic story that explains and justifies our own behavior.

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS Feedback is delivered in vague labels, and we are prone to wrong spotting. To understand your feedback, discuss where it is: Coming from: their data and interpretations Going to: advice, consequences, expectations Ask: What’s different about The data we are looking at Our interpretations and implicit rules Ask: What’s right about the feedback to seek out what’s legit and what concerns you have in common. Working together to get a more complete picture maximizes the chances you will (both) learn something.

I say it’s because no one else wanted it (situation).

USE YOUR REACTION AS A BLIND-SPOT ALERT

When you notice yourself wondering What was their agenda? and What’s wrong with them?, make sure your next thought is I wonder if this feedback is sitting in my blind spot.

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS We all have blind spots because we: can’t see our own leaky faces can’t hear our tone of voice are unaware of even big patterns of behavior Blind spots are amplified by: Emotional Math: We discount our emotions, while others count them double. Attribution: We attribute our failure to the situation, while others attribute it to our character. Impact-Intent Gap: We judge ourselves by our intentions, while others judge us by our impact on them. To see ourselves and our blind spots we need help from others. Invite others to be an honest mirror to help you see yourself in the moment. Ask: How am I getting in my own way?

RELATIONSHIP TRIGGERS and the challenge of WE

Relationship Triggers (and the Challenge of WE)

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS We can be triggered by who is giving us the feedback. What we think about the giver: Are they credible? Do we trust them? Did they deliver our feedback with good judgment and skill? How we feel treated by the giver: Do we feel accepted? Appreciated? Like our autonomy is respected? Relationship triggers create switchtrack conversations, where we have two topics on the table and talk past each other. Spot the two topics and give each its own track. Surprise players in the feedback game: Strangers People we find difficult People we find difficult see us at our worst and may be especially well placed to be honest mirrors about areas where we have the most room to grow. Listen for relationship issues lurking beneath coaching.

Identify the Relationship System Take Three Steps Back

Back You’re sitting at breakfast with your wife, who is sleep-deprived and agitated. She’s got some feedback for you: Do something about the snoring. Don’t try to pin this on the dog. It’s not the TV or the neighbors. “It’s very simple,” she says. “You snore. I can’t sleep. You’ve got a problem. Fix it.” You wouldn’t dream of blaming the dog. That’s ridiculous. The real problem here is your wife. She tells the story this way: “You snore. The End.” But you know better. Yes, you do snore. But

6 Identify the Relationship System Take Three Steps Back

When something goes wrong in a system, we each see some things the other doesn’t, and these observations are not randomly distributed between us. When something goes wrong, I tend to see the things that you did that led to it, and you tend to see the things I did.

If we’re going to have better conversations about feedback, we need a better handle on the ways that giver and receiver (and often others) are contributing to the problem under discussion.

ONE STEP BACK: YOU + ME INTERSECTIONS Feedback is often expressed as “This is how you are, and that’s the problem.” But in relationships, “This is how you are” really means “This is how you are in relationship to how I am.” It’s the combination—the intersection of our differences—that is often causing the problem.

As one HR executive joked, “In HR, we’re not happy until you’re not happy.”

It’s essential to disentangle the individual from their role by taking two steps back and asking: How are our roles contributing to how we see each other, and to the feedback we give each other?

FEEDBACK THROUGH A SYSTEMS LENS

Seeing Feedback in the System One Step Back: In what ways does the feedback reflect differences in preferences, assumptions, styles, or implicit rules between us? Two Steps Back: Do our roles make it more or less likely that we might bump into each other? Three Steps Back: What other players influence our behavior and choices? Are physical setups, processes, or structures also contributing to the problem? Circling Back to Me: What am I doing (or failing to do) that is contributing to the dynamic between us?

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS To understand the feedback you get, take three steps back: One Step Back: You + Me intersections. Are differences between us creating the friction? Two Steps Back: Role clashes. Is this partly a result of the roles we play in the organization or the family? Three Steps Back: Big picture. Are processes, policies, physical environment, or other players reinforcing the problem? Looking at systems: Reduces judgment Enhances accountability Uncovers root causes Look for patterns in your feedback. Is this a You + Everybody intersection? Take responsibility for your part.

7 Learn how Wiring and Temperament Affect Your Story

Research suggests a 50-40-10 formula for happiness: About 50 percent of our happiness is wired in. Another 40 percent can be attributed to how we interpret and respond to what happens to us, and 10 percent is driven by our circumstances—where we live and with whom, where we work and with whom, the state of our health, and so forth.

8 Dismantle Distortions See Feedback at “Actual Size”

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS Before we can decide what we think of the feedback we get, we need to remove the distortions: Be prepared, be mindful — recognize your feedback footprint. Separate the strands — of feeling / story / feedback. Contain the story — what is this about and what isn’t it about? Change your vantage point — to another, to the future, to the comedy. Accept that you can’t control how others see you. Don’t buy their story about you wholesale. Others’ views of you are input, not imprint. Reach out to supportive mirrors who can help you see yourself with compassion and balance.

9 Cultivate a Growth Identity Sort Toward Coaching

IDENTITY: OUR SELF-STORY

GIVE UP SIMPLE LABELS AND CULTIVATE COMPLEXITY

So, while simple labels help orient us in the world, they don’t hold up well against the complexity of the world.

Here’s the bottom line: As long as you tell your self-story in these black-and-white terms, you will find no peace. You can’t choose between whether you’re a good person or a bad person. Whichever you select, there is evidence for the opposite conclusion.

You will make mistakes, you have complex intentions, and you have contributed to the problem.

Accepting that we’re not perfect also means giving up the idea that being perfect is a viable way to escape negative feedback.3 It’s a seductive thought, but it doesn’t work; you can’t behave your way out of ever receiving feedback. You can’t outrun it, and you will collapse trying. Accepting imperfection is not just a good idea, it’s the only choice.

those with growth mindsets are “amazingly accurate” in gauging their current abilities, while people with fixed mindsets are “terrible” at estimating their own proficiencies.

Growth identity folks aren’t thrown by the contradiction and are motivated to seek accurate information in order to adjust and learn.

Upon successful completion, half the children were told: “Wow, you’re really smart!” The other half were told: “Wow, you worked hard at that puzzle!” Then both groups were asked what they would like to do next: a harder puzzle or an easier one. Guess which group opted for the challenge? You guessed it. One thing to learn from this study is that praising our kids for their intelligence is, surprisingly, counterproductive to their learning. We’re better off extolling their effort if we’re hoping to encourage them to take on new challenges.

The first step is to be aware of your own tendencies. Are you more inclined to live in the Testing Room or the Learning Room? Do you experience challenges as threats to your identity or as opportunities for growth?

you run through this sorting exercise a few times, you’ll notice three things. First, you’ll see that with some effort you can hear most feedback either way. Second, if you’re successful in hearing it as coaching, you’ll notice that your identity reaction is diminished or gone. And third, you’ll start to notice patterns—your own tendencies.

Whatever else you do to cope, imagine that there is an invisible second evaluation. After every low score you receive, after each failure and faltering step, give yourself a “second score” based on how you handle the first score. In every situation in life, there’s the situation itself, and then there’s how you handle it. Even when you get an F for the situation itself, you can still earn an A+ for how you deal with it.

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS Our ability to take in and metabolize feedback is affected by how we tell our identity story. Shift from: Simple all-or-nothing to realistically complex. Fixed to growth — so that you see challenge as opportunity, and feedback as useful information for learning. Three practices help: 1. Sort for coaching. Hear coaching as coaching, and find the coaching in evaluation. 2. When evaluated, separate the judgment from assessment and consequences. 3. Give yourself a second score for how you handle the first score.

How Good Do I have to Be?

Summary: SOME KEY IDEAS Boundaries: The ability to turn down or turn away feedback is critical to healthy relationships and lifelong learning. Three kinds of boundaries: Thanks and No — I’m happy to hear your coaching … and I may not take it. Not Now, Not About That — I need time or space, or this is too sensitive a subject right now. No Feedback — Our relationship rides on your ability to keep your judgments to yourself. When turning down feedback, use “and” to be appreciative, and firm. Be specific about: The request The time frame The consequences Their assent If you’re not changing, work to mitigate the impact on others. Ask about the impact Coach them to deal with the unchanged you Problem solve together

Navigate the Conversation

Be alert for challenging mixes (coaching with evaluation) and cross-transactions (I wanted coaching but you’re giving me appreciation).

BODY: FOUR SKILLS FOR MANAGING THE CONVERSATION

Listening includes asking clarifying questions, paraphrasing the giver’s view, and acknowledging their feelings.

Asserting is a mix of sharing, advocating, and expressing—in essence, talking.

The third skill involves process moves—hinges that turn the conversation in a more productive direction. You are acting as your own referee, stepping outside the conversation, noticing where you and the giver are stuck, and suggesting a better direction, topic, or process.

Finally, problem solving turns to the question: Now what? Why does this feedback matter, and what should one or both of us do about it?

What Helps? Listen with a Purpose

Talk to your internal voice. Acknowledge and appreciate it (they’re your own thoughts, after all). Remind it that understanding doesn’t equal agreeing.

And the ability to learn from feedback is what will shape your future most.

13 Pull Together Feedback in Organizations

THERE ARE NO PERFECT FEEDBACK SYSTEMS

The greatest leverage is helping the people inside the system communicate more effectively, and as between giver and receiver, it’s the receiver’s skills that have the most impact. We need to equip receivers to create pull—to drive their own learning, to seek honest mirrors as well as supportive mirrors, to speak up when they need additional appreciation or coaching or are confused about where they stand.

MODEL LEARNING, REQUEST COACHING

You don’t have to depend on your annual review or your boss’s willingness to mentor. You can watch, ask questions, and solicit suggestions from coworkers, customers, partners, and friends.
