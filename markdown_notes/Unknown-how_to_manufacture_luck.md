## Type I: Blind Luck

winning the lottery, being born in a stable economy, or inheriting a favourable genetic constitution.

Type I luck represents the “baseline environment” or the initial conditions of the simulation.

## Type II: Luck from Motion

It’s the luck of the hustler. By generating a high volume of actions (attending events, cold emailing, shipping code, testing prototypes) you increase the collision rate with random opportunities.

## Type III: Luck from Awareness

involves spotting opportunities that are invisible to others because they lack the specific knowledge or experience to recognize them.

This requires deep study and the cultivation of ‘specific knowledge’: skills that are highly technical or creative and cannot be easily outsourced or automated.

## Type IV: Luck from Uniqueness

occurs when your unique character, brand, or reputation attracts opportunity to you.

This requires the construction of a “Personal Monopoly” or a distinct brand. It relies heavily on the “Telling” variable, broadcasting your unique combination of skills so effectively that the network routes all relevant opportunities to that node.

# Rules on How to Manufacture Luck

## Taking More Shots

When in doubt, do something.

In contrast, doing nothing yields nothing

For instance, if you’re considering launching a small online business, jumping in and selling a first product will teach you more (and create more openings) than months of debating and planning.Fortune tends to favour the ones who do rather than those who endlessly deliberate.

## Being Visible

Don’t keep your passions and projects secret, share your work so others know what you’re up to.

The simple formula is: do great work, and make sure people know about it; many lucky breaks come from this combination.
