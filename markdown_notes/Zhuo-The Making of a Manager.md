Great Managers Are Made, Not Born

I’ve made countless mistakes. But this is how anything in life goes: You try something. You figure out what worked and what didn’t. You file away lessons for the future.

I believe this as deeply as I believe anything: Great managers are made, not born.

# Chapter One What Is Management?

A MANAGER’S JOB IS TO … build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals, and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently.

This is the crux of management: It is the belief that a team of people can achieve more than a single person going it alone. It is the realization that you don’t have to do everything yourself, be the best at everything yourself, or even know how to do everything yourself. Your job, as a manager, is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together.

Half of what he looked at was my team’s results—did we achieve our aspirations in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half was based on the strength and satisfaction of my team—did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together? The first criterion looks at our team’s present outcomes; the second criterion asks whether we’re set up for great outcomes in the future.

So how does a manager help a group of people achieve great outcomes?

Hackman’s research describes five conditions that increase a team’s odds of success: having a real team (one with clear boundaries and stable membership),3 a compelling direction, an enabling structure, a supportive organizational context, and expert coaching.

Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.

## HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU’LL BE A GREAT MANAGER?

Do I Find It More Motivating to Achieve a Particular Outcome or to Play a Specific Role?

Do I Like Talking with People?

major part of your responsibility is ensuring that the individuals you support are able to thrive. This means that listening to and talking with them are a core part of the job.

Can I Provide Stability for an Emotionally Challenging Situation?

“What makes a good leader is that they eschew the spotlight in favor of spending time and energy to do what they need to do to support and protect their people,”

the role of a manager can be given to someone (or taken away), leadership is not something that can be bestowed. It must be earned. People must want to follow you.

# Chapter Two Your First Three Months

## THE PIONEER

In your first few one-on-one meetings, ask your reports the following questions to understand what their “dream manager” looks like. What did you and your past manager discuss that was most helpful to you? What are the ways in which you’d like to be supported? How do you like to be recognized for great work? What kind of feedback is most useful for you? Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?

# Chapter Three Leading a Small Team

Remember our definition of management? A manager’s job is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together through influencing purpose, people, and process.

What leads people to do great work?

What gets in the way of good work? There are only two possibilities.1 The first is that people don’t know how to do good work. The second is that they know how, but they aren’t motivated.

“You must trust people,2 or life becomes impossible,” the writer Anton Chekhov once said.

You have more impact on their day-to-day than they have on yours. This means that the responsibility of building a trusting relationship lies more with you than with them.

“remember this: managing is caring.”

don’t fall into the trap of thinking that because you’re the boss, you can’t admit your shortcomings or weaknesses. Instead, apologize. Admit that you screwed up, and take meaningful action to do better in the future.

the thing that’s often the most helpful isn’t advice or answers but empathy.

power in expressing vulnerability: “Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage.4 Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness.”

# Chapter Four The Art of Feedback

## WHAT DOES GREAT FEEDBACK LOOK LIKE?

Give Task-Specific Feedback as Frequently as You Can

When you do have critical feedback to share, approach it with a sense of curiosity and an honest desire to understand your report’s perspective. One simple way to do this is to state your point directly and then follow up with, “Does this feedback resonate with you? Why or why not?”

How do you ensure that your feedback can be acted upon? Remember these three tips.

1. Make your feedback as specific as possible.

2. Clarify what success looks and feels like.

3. Suggest next steps

# Chapter Five Managing Yourself

Every manager feels like an imposter sometimes.

There are some useful frameworks for understanding your strengths, like StrengthsFinder 2.0 by Tom Rath or StandOut by Marcus Buckingham. If you want to do a quick version, jot down the first thing that comes to mind when you ask yourself the following questions: How would the people who know and like me best (family, significant other, close friends) describe me in three words? MY ANSWER: thoughtful, enthusiastic, driven What three qualities do I possess that I am the proudest of? MY ANSWER: curious, reflective, optimistic When I look back on something I did that was successful, what personal traits do I give credit to? MY ANSWER: vision, determination, humility What are the top three most common pieces of positive feedback that I’ve received from my manager or peers? MY ANSWER: principled, fast learner, long-term thinker

Right beneath your list of strengths, answer the following: Whenever my worst inner critic sits on my shoulder, what does she yell at me for? MY ANSWER: getting distracted, worrying too much about what others think, not voicing what I believe If a magical fairy were to come and bestow on me three gifts I don’t yet have, what would they be? MY ANSWER: bottomless well of confidence, clarity of thought, incredible persuasion What are three things that trigger me? (A trigger is a situation that gets me more worked up than it should.) MY ANSWER: sense of injustice, the idea that someone else thinks I’m incompetent, people with inflated egos What are the top three most common pieces of feedback from my manager or peers on how I could be more effective? MY ANSWER: be more direct, take more risks, explain things simply

(There’s even a term to describe the cognitive bias where people who aren’t actually very skilled have a tendency to think they’re better than they are: the Dunning-Kruger effect.2

Calibration matters because it doesn’t do me any good to think that I’m one thing when the world views me as another.

In her influential book Mindset,3 pioneering psychologist Carol Dweck describes how the two different mindsets—which she calls fixed and growth—make a huge difference in our performance and personal happiness. Observe the difference: SCENARIO: After completing an assignment, your manager gives you a few suggestions for improvement. FIXED MINDSET: Ugh, I really messed that up. My manager must think I’m an idiot. GROWTH MINDSET: I’m thankful my manager gave me those tips. Now all my future assignments are going to go better.

## UNDERSTAND YOURSELF AT YOUR BEST AND WORST Beyond strengths and weaknesses,

## Ask for Feedback

Remember to ask for both task-specific and behavioral feedback.

probe at the specifics and make it easy for someone to tell you something actionable.

## Make a Mentor Out of Everyone

## GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO COME PREPARED

they experienced what social psychologists call “the curse of knowledge”—the cognitive bias that makes it difficult for them to remember what it’s like to be a beginner seeing the content for the first time.

## Get Feedback about Your Meeting

Remember that the key to getting great feedback is being specific about what you want to know and making it safe for the person to tell you her honest opinion. Leading with what you suspect may be an issue signals that it’s okay for the person to be critical.

# Chapter Eight Making Things Happen

Jeff Bezos says, “Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had.8 If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow.”

# Chapter Ten Nurturing Culture

Nothing at Facebook Is Somebody Else’s Problem.

## NEVER STOP TALKING ABOUT WHAT’S IMPORTANT

Assume that for the message to stick, it should be heard ten different times and said in ten different ways.

ALWAYS WALK THE WALK

If you say something is important to you and you’d like the rest of your team to care about it, be the first person to live that value

## INVENT TRADITIONS THAT CELEBRATE YOUR VALUES

Here are some examples:

Monthly “Learn how to paint/sculpt/craft” nights to encourage creativity and beginner’s mindset

Personal prompts (like “Favorite childhood movie” or “Best gift you ever received at Christmas”) at the start of a meeting so people can get to know their teammates better

“Fail of the week,” where people share their mistakes in a safe forum to encourage authenticity and learning
