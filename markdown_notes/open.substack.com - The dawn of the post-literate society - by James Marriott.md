Perhaps no great social transformation has ever been carried out so quietly.

in the middle of the eighteenth century huge numbers of ordinary people began to read.

Even more importantly print changed how people thought.

The world as we know it was forged in the reading revolution.

Now, we are living through the counter-revolution.

If the reading revolution represented the greatest transfer of knowledge to ordinary men and women in history, the screen revolution represents the greatest theft of knowledge from ordinary people in history.

As Walter Ong writes in his book Orality and Literacy, certain kinds of complex and logical thinking simply cannot be achieved without reading and writing. It is virtually impossible to develop a detailed and logical argument in spontaneous speech — you would get lost, lose your thread, contradict yourself, and confuse your audience trying to re-phrase ineptly expressed points.

Philosophy cannot exist without criticism . . . writing makes it possible and convenient to subject thought to a continuous and concentrated scrutiny. Writing freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the grammarian, the logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the scientist-all those who must hold language before them so that they can see what it means, where it errs, and where it is leading.

Books are far from perfect but they are much more closely bound to the imperatives of logical argument than any other means of human communication ever devised.

Politics in the age of short form video favours heightened emotion, ignorance and unevidenced assertions.

They don’t want you to think. Thinking is where certainty goes to die.
