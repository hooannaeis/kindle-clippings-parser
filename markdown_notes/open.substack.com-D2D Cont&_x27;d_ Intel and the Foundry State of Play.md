Without Intel, and Samsung Foundry on shaky ground, there is a non-zero chance that TSMC becomes a true monopoly. And like any monopolist it will eventually raise prices to the point where many customers will choose to delay moving to advanced nodes, which will slow down the entire technology industry.

The less mentioned corollary to Moore’s Law (sometimes called Rock’s Law) holds that the cost of building semis fabs capable of producing at that leading edge goes up almost as quickly. Today, a leading edge fab costs about $20 billion, most of which goes to tooling.
