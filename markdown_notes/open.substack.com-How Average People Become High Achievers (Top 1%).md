I now understand the secret to confidence is just to be yourself. No fakery. No acting. No fancy logos. No polished Instagram pictures. No highlight reels. No “here’s my Lambo, bro.” Nope. Just be yourself.

2. Obsess over having “proof of work”

3. Worship creation over consumption disguised as creation

If you break down 99% of hobbies or passions, you’ll find most of them are nothing but consumption in disguise.

4. Don’t play lottery life games

There are two types of opportunities: 1) Real opportunities 2) Opportunities disguised as gambling.

You’re statistically more likely to get wealthy doing boring stuff in saturated markets that help normal people solve real problems.

Level 1 - Follow orders

5. Ascend the 3 levels of living

Level 2 - Question everything

Only when you question everything can you start to believe anything new.

Level 3 - Make up the rules

As you keep moving forward you start to realize there are no rules. Everyone is just making stuff up as they go.

6. Don’t give a damn about “potential”

7. See “being busy” as the lowest form of intelligence in existence

We’re born with potential but it doesn’t mean we’ll use it.

High achievers are insanely focused on a psychopathically small list of priorities.

8. Become the most unhinged version of yourself

9. Don’t optimize for a high-paying career

Because trying to earn money doing something you don’t give a fudge about rarely turns into success. You just lose motivation and quit.

Chasing money leads to piss-weak motivation. You’ll never be able to maintain the habits needed to become a high achiever if that’s your main driver.

10. See rudeness as a massive red flag

11. Say yes and figure out how to make it happen later
