(There is a Moore’s Second Law, also known as Rock’s Law, which posits that the cost of a semiconductor fab doubles every four years.)

The semiconductor fabrication process

The process for building up the structure of a microchip can be broken down into four basic operations, repeatedly applied: layering, patterning, doping, and heat-treating.

Layering is used to add an extremely thin layer of material — as little as a nanometer or less, 1/100,000th the thickness of a human hair — to the surface of the wafer.

Patterning is the process of inscribing specific patterns on the wafer, selectively removing material as needed to create electronic components.

Doping is the process of introducing very small amounts of impurities into a semiconductor material to change its electrical conductivity.



The difficulty and expense of semiconductor manufacturing

One chemical, the chlorine trifluoride used for cleaning CVD chambers, is so toxic and so prone to spontaneous ignition (it's capable of setting wet sand on fire) that some chemists refuse to work with it
