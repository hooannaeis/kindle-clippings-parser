Learning “how your organization works” is a constant exercise in learning the organization’s ever-changing landscape, especially as people, projects, priorities, partners, and leadership change.

Software engineers frustrated at being “stuck” in their career often did no proper attempt to understand how their organization works.

Who are the people who are accessible to me and are “in the know” for different areas? What is the implicit hierarchy at my workplace? Who are the most important engineers / product people that everyone seems to seek out informal advice from? Is my workspace culture actually top-down, bottom-up, or both?
